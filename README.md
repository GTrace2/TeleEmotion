# TeleEmotion 🎥😊

Welcome to TeleEmotion - A project that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning to analyze and recognize emotions from video feeds!

## About the Project 📖
TeleEmotion aims to develop a robust convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting and classifying human emotions from video data, facilitating enhanced human-computer interaction.

## Features ✨
- Real-time Emotion Detection: Analyze emotions from live video feeds in real-time.
- High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced CNN architectures for precise emotion classification.
- Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets with high efficiency.

## Model Architecture 🏗️
The model architecture of TeleEmotion includes several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Extracts features from the input images.
- **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the outputs of the convolutional layers.
- **Activation Functions:** Uses ReLU for non-linearity.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduces dimensionality.
- **Dropout:** Prevents overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Combines features to make predictions.
